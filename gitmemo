You can store your credentials using the following command

$ git config credential.helper store
$ git push http://example.com/repo.git
Username: <type your username>
Password: <type your password>
Also I suggest you to read
$ git help credentials

Adding a remote
To add a new remote, use the git remote add command on the terminal, in the directory your repository is stored at.

The git remote add command takes two arguments:

A remote name, for example, origin
A remote URL, for example, https://github.com/user/repo.git
For example:

git remote add origin https://github.com/user/repo.git
# Set a new remote

git remote -v
# Verify new remote
origin  https://github.com/user/repo.git (fetch)
origin  https://github.com/user/repo.git (push)
